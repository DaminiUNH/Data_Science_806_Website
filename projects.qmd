### 🐠 Coral Reef Biodiversity (2006–2015)

-**Goal:** Understand long-term biodiversity trends in coral reef fish communities.  
-**Tools:** R, tidyverse, ggplot2  

**Highlights:**
- Processed BioTIME dataset (French Polynesia)
- Computed annual species richness & total abundance
- Visualized biodiversity changes over a decade  

📄 *Read full report:* [Coral Reef Biodiversity Analysis](docs/Temporal_Trends_Coral_Reef_Biodiversity.pdf)

### 🧫 CHO Cell Growth & Media Optimization

-**Goal:** Compare serum-free vs. supplemented media in CHO cell culture.  

**Focus Areas:**
- Media prep (HyClone SFM4CHO + L-Glutamine)
- Cell viability and karyotyping
- Data visualization using R (growth curves)  

📊 *Includes:* Lonza medium protocol & cell viability results.
