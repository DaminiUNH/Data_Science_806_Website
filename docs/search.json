    "text": "Working in the cell culture lab feels like exploring a living world under glass.\nFrom maintaining CHO and SKOV3 lines to prepping media with L-Glutamine and Poloxamer 188, every step matters.\nIn this post, I reflect on how precision, sterility, and observation shape reliable data — and why contamination control is more than a checklist, it’s a mindset."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Preparing SFM4CHO medium for the first time taught me the importance of precision and patience.\nFrom weighing NaHCO₃ to filtering through a 0.2 µm membrane, small steps make big differences in culture performance.\nThis experience showed me that lab work is part science, part art — and every successful experiment starts with careful preparation."
